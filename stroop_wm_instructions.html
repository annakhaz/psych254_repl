<p align="center" style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px; color:white;font:18px/30px arial,sans-serif;font-weight:bolder"> Each trial of the task has several parts and requires you to make two responses. 
<br>  As shown in the diagram below, before each trial begins you will see an asterisk, then you will see a word written at the center of the screen.
<br> Your job is to remember that word, because you will be tested on it at the end of trial. 
<br> After a few seconds a colored rectangle will appear on the screen.
<br> Your job is to report the color of that rectangle as quickly and accurately as possible, using the buttons indicated in the diagram below.
<br> 'A' = red &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  'S' = blue &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'J' = green &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 'K' = yellow
<br> After another short delay, you will see a word on the screen with instructions to indicate whether it is the same or a different word from the WORD you were asked to remember at the beginning of the trial. 
<br> Press the number '1' if it is the same as the word from beginning of the trial. Press '0 (zero)' if it is a different word </p>
